# HANGMAN GAME console version
---------------------------------
This is the classic style hangman game, that has been completely designed using Python.

Execute the *"hangman_main.py"* file in your PC, and enjoy the game, being alone or with friends! Each step is clearly stated, throughout the gameplay!!!

The program supports some cool features. One such feature is getting HINT, while guessing the word.

If you want it to be more challenging, then clone this project into your computer, and just add some long words into the *"words.txt"* file, essentially greater than 9 alphabets long.
All the added words will then be added to the game glossary, and you can make it supper challenging on your own!
